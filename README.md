- Iâ€™m currently working on **Breakout**
- This game is all about trying to destroy all the bricks before the ball falls to the ground

<h3> **INSTRUCTONS** </h3>

- Move the paddle **LEFT** by pressing the **Left Arrow**
- Move the paddle **RIGHT** by pressing the **Right Arrow**
- **GAME OVER** if the ball falls below your paddle
- **WIN** if all bricks are destroyed 

- thanks for playing my game! 

- special thanks to MDN Web Docs and Stack overflow for helping me get through this project
